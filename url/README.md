# Challenge

Hey, Santiago here. I been learning web app development and created a super secure web app. I bet you can't abuse its authentication mechanisms and impersonate my user (`santiago`). But if you can, check my profile because **the flag you are looking for is the API Key.** 

> Note: This challenge has been designed so that you can solve it **without** brute forcing the web app or using a dictionary attack on the password field.

Anyways, you can find the web app in the link below.
