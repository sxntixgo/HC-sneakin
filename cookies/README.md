# Challenge

The previous two versions were *way* too easy for a hacker like you! Nevermind, I came up with this **delicious authentication mechanism** and the previous attacks won't work. Can you get my user's API key?

> Note: This challenge has been designed so that you can solve it without brute forcing the web app or using a dictionary attack on the password field.

Version 3 of the web app is here:

http://127.0.0.1:8090

# Docker

## Run docker

```
docker compose up --build
```

The web application will run in http://127.0.0.1:8090

## Remove docker containers

```
docker container prune
```
