# Challenge

Hey, Santiago here! The previous challenges were just a test and this is where things get real. By know you should probably know what the flag is and where to find it. Also, you probably already know what JWTs are. Well... here's another JWT challenge! Find the vulnerability, exploit it to impersonate `santiago` and get the API Key.

> Note: This challenge has been designed so that you can solve it without brute forcing the web app or using a dictionary attack on the password field.

You will find the app URL below.
